# # Essies Ltd Sales Analysis Project

This project was executed to analyze the sales data of Essies Ltd's new product launch. The aim was to identify the sales trends in different segments of customers and regions. 

## Data Preparation

To analyze the data, I created reference tables for the date and products. It was important to keep the product category table separate in the model. I also created a separate table for the product subcategory and prioritized the retail sales in terms of high, mid, and low categories. I included an interactive slicer for the country flag in the report. The following metrics were highlighted in the Essies Dashboard:

- Units Sold by Category
- Total Unit sold
- Retail Unit Sold
- Sales Unit Sold

The top 10 retailers were highlighted in terms of unit sold. The top-performing products were also identified based on unit sold. The top-performing subcategories were identified based on unit sold.

## Marketing Analysis

Important details:

- Unit sold in Promotion events in terms of reseller, no discount, and Customers
- Unit sold in terms Components, Accessories, clothing, Bikes
- Unit sold in terms of retail counter

The Essies Ltd Sales Analysis project was executed successfully to analyze the sales trends in different segments of customers and regions. The project provided valuable insights into the sales performance of the new product launch.
