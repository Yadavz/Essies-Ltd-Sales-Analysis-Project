The Essies Ltd Sales Analysis project was aimed at analyzing the sales data of Essies Ltd's new product launch to identify sales trends in different customer and region segments. The project involved creating reference tables for dates, products, and product categories, as well as an interactive slicer for the country flag in the report. Key metrics highlighted in the Essies Dashboard included units sold by category, total units sold, retail units sold, and sales unit sold. The project also identified top-performing retailers, products, and subcategories based on unit sold. Additionally, the project analyzed unit sold in promotion events, components, accessories, clothing, bikes, and retail counters. The project provided valuable insights into the sales performance of the new product launch and can be downloaded and used by cloning or downloading the repository and opening the Power BI project file (.pbix) with Power BI Desktop.
